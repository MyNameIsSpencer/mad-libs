Fighting evil by my tights, winning love by strobe light
Never running from a fight night, she is the one named Sailor Moon.

She will never turn her back on her friend.
She is always there to defend.
She is the one in whom we can depend.

She is the one named Sailorrrrrr ...

Sailor Moon!
Sailor Noon!
Sailor Boon!
Sailor Sailor!

With secret powers all so new to her
She is the one named Sailor Moon.
